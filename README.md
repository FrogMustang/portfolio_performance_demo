## Purpose
The purpose of the project was to implement a portfolio overview demo, where the user can see some plotted chart data about a mocked portfolio and interacti with it. Moreover, I aimed for a high code coverage and tried my bes to test it well.

## Challenges
Had a bit of a struggle with using gRPC and Protos since the experience of using packages like Freezed or JsonSerializable are more smooth

## How to run
I suggest using [FVM](https://fvm.app/documentation/getting-started/installation) to run the app using Flutter 3.38.3 for the best experience.

## Can't build the project?
If you don't have the environment to run the code, here is a video and some screenshots of what it looks like:
